# C: Pretty print a table
This is a pretty direct implementation of printing a table with left aligned text. Written by Max review by Julian.

I like the defining array size in the function rather than passing around a pointer, it helps to self document the code and may save you from alignment quirks (I don't know what the standards say about array packing).
