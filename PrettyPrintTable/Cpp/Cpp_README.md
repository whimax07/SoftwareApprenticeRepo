# C++: Pretty print a table
This one is a bit weird. You can very likely do some very cool things to make this a generic container. I'm not going to do that as it sounds like a weeks or months long project to get it working nicely. :) Writen by Max reviewed by Adam.

Repeated calls to `std::cout` or any io are can be slow. If you were wanting to get performance value of this measure to see if generating the whole string version of the table then printing it is faster.
